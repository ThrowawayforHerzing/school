	<main>
		<p>The easiest way to build credit is to keep a single credit card that you make small purchases with and pay your balance off in full each month.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Do not apply for many cards at once.
			<li>Do not use more than 30% of your avaliable credit at once.
			<li>Pay your bills on time.
		<ul>
